		 * the right instead of just a math expression.  When this
		 * occurs, that variable/lit-value pair needs to be stored
		 * somewhere, so we can look it up later when we doMath.  You
		 * might choose to create a VariableEnvironment object that holds
		 * an array of Variable objects, where a Variable object
		 * holds a variable name and a integer value.  The VariableEnv
		 * should allow us to add variables to it, and retrieve the 
		 * value given a variable name.  Then finish doMath to support
		 * variables.  Note that your parser must now be able to parse
		 * multiple statements in a row. (ie things separated by ;)
